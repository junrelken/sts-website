				<h2>"Technology for Millennials"</h2>
						<p> Millennials have often led older Americans in
					their adoption and use of technology, and this largely holds true today.
					But there has been significant growth in tech adoption since 2012 among
					older generations – particularly Gen Xers and Baby Boomers.
					More than nine-in-ten Millennials (93% of those who turn ages 23 to 38 this year)
					own smartphones, compared with 90% of Gen Xers (those ages 39 to 54 this year),
					68% of Baby Boomers (ages 55 to 73) and 40% of the Silent Generation (74 to 91),
					according to a new analysis of a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted in early 2019.
					Similarly, the vast majority of Millennials (86%) say they use social media,
					compared with smaller shares among older generations. While the share of Millennials
					who say they use social media has remained largely unchanged since 2012,</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="course-col"
					<h2>"Technology for Millennials"</h2>
						<p>the shares of Gen Xers, Boomers and Silents who use social media all have increased
						by at least 10 percentage points during this period.
						Unlike with smartphones and social media, tablet ownership is now comparable across most generations.
						Today, 55% of Gen Xers, 53% of Millennials and 52% of Boomers say they own tablets.
						A smaller share of Silents (33%) report owning tablets. Those in the Silent
						Generation also lag when it comes to having broadband service at home.
						Whereas most Millennials (78%), Gen Xers (78%) and Boomers (74%) say they
						subscribe to home broadband, fewer than half of Silents (45%) say this. Almost all Millennials (nearly 100%) now say they use the internet,
						and 19% of them are smartphone-only internet users – that is, they own a
						smartphone but do not have broadband internet service at home. Large shares
						f Gen Xers (91%) and Boomers (85%) use the internet, compared with just 62% of Silents.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="course-col"
				<h2>"Technology for Millennials"</h2>
						<p>hen it comes to smartphone-only internet users, 17% of Gen Xers go online primarily via
						a smartphone, as do 11% of Boomers and 15% of Silents. Baby Boomers continue to
						trail both Gen Xers and Millennials on most measures of technology adoption, but
						adoption rates for this group have been growing rapidly in recent years. For example,
						Boomers are now far more likely to own a smartphone than they were in 2011 (68% now vs. 25% then).
						Although Boomers have been adopting a range of technologies in recent years, members of the Silent
						Generation are less likely to have done so. Four-in-ten Silents (40%) report owning a smartphone,
						and fewer (33%) indicate that they have a tablet computer or use social media (28%). Previous Pew
						Research Center surveys have found that the oldest adults face some unique barriers to adopting new
						technologies – from a lack of confidence in using new technologies to physical challenges manipulating various devices.</p>

					<h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning</h2>
					<p>What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
					Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence
					in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
					The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a
					human mind such as learning and problem-solving. The ideal characteristic of artificial
					intelligence is its ability to rationalizeand take actions that have the best chance of
					achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which
					efers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new
					ata without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning
					through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.</p>

					<h2>"Technology for Millennials"</h2>
					<p>The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and
					AI systems reaching over $57 billion in 2022.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will
					be created in development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI
					also offers some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer)
					o $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend you must watch out for!</p>

					<h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning</h2>
					<p>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different
					sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different
					treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.
					Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars.
					Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result.
					In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external
					data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.
					Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry,
					where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account
					deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier.
					This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.</p>
